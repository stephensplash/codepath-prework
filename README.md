**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Stephen Mgbemeje

Time spent: 20 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
No outside resourses were used.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
  A challenge I encountered was actually having a deep understanding of what the functions were doing by reading the code. This project was my first time working with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML so I had to start from a foundational level in order to understand what was going on in the code. As I wrote the JavaScript functions, it was hard for me to conceptualize what some parts of the code was trying to do. I overcame this issue by diving deeper into the pre-work instructions. I made it a point to understand the concepts incrementally. I would try to figure out what one line code meant at a time and then pull together the big picture. By doing this I was able to have a deep understanding of code that I had no experience in prior.  

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  I had a basic HTML/CSS style and focused on finishing functionality with Javascript. Once I had all the features, I started playing around with color palettes, Bootstrap containers, placement, alignment, etc. It was like putting together LEGO and trying different variations. I would be curious to learn more about creating stylish and user-friendly UI and UX efficiently. Furthermore, I'd like to see how I could incorporate my Adobe Illustrator skills into it. I have heard of some programs that allow you to design the website UI first and then get the HMLT/CSS code for it. I would be curious to see how the code and design interact with each other in such programs.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  I want my game to be friendly for all devices. Hence, I would turn away from fixed quantities like width: 50px and go to percentages to ensure that mobile users don't have to struggle with gigantic buttons. Then, I would factor several functions. As a technical challenge, I would attempt using other sounds, such as bass guitar or drums. This would spice up the game and also train musical hearing skills. I would continue iterating upon the design. Specifically, when I added button 8, it jumps onto the second row. It'd be better if my buttons were placed in the center with margins and would altogether form a large square rather than a single line. I would make adding buttons more efficient with a loop, rather than repeating my code many times and copy-pasting the same lines. It'd be handy to store the results and stats for every user. I could use cookies or a database, but that would require backend. I could add many other features, but the last, and essential one, is the colorblind mode. My buttons involve many colors, and having a toggle that turns them into colorblind colors would add accessibility to my users.
